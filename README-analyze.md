This is a forked version of truffle "next" (as of v5 beta), which adds Mythril Platform.

The specific analyze function is pulled in as a git submodule in the github private consensys/truffle-analyze repo

If you clone this to get the submodule:

* `git submodule init`
* `git submodule update --remote`
